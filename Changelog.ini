- Stop using Test::Stream. Use Test::More shipped in the Test::Simple distro.
See RT#116931. Thanx to Chad Granum aka EXODIST.
- Update version #s in pre-reqs.
- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.

- No code changes.
- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.

Comments= <<EOT
- Disable testing images in t/test.t because some CPAN testers have installed Imager without
support for *.ttf fonts. So, a group of tests have been commented out.
- Remove t/FreeSansBold.ttf, t/wikipedia.01.clad and wikipedia.01.png from the disto.
There is no point in shipping these files now that they can't be used.
